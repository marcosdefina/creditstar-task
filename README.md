  This project was made using Vue2

  You can build it by yourself, but I'll let the built version hosted in this repository.

  ### So, if you just want to see it working, you gonna need:

   - A http server (you can install wherever way you want, but it's easier if you have node package manager):
      > npm install http-server

   - And inside the 'dist/' folder run:
      > http-server

  ### If you want to build by yourself, you gonna need:

   - Node Package Manager -
     you can install in a lot of different ways, but I suggest [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm):
      > nvm install node

   - With Node installed you gonna need to import project dependencies:
      > npm install
   - Now you can build:
      > npm run build 
   - Or run the development build, if you want:
      > npm run serve
      
# Issues
 - No navbar buttons and modals
 - No footer (but come on, footer is dying in the new design trends)
 
I tryed all the time to build from scratch, all the grid logic in css and sass, but near to the deadline I had to change my plans and work faster.

I installed UI Kit, where I could make it responsible, but didn't have time to remove all the grid I had done, so, the mobile layout is broken right now.

I have other tasks to do this weekend, and other next week, so I'm sorry, I cannot work on it more, I hope the commit history can show you I could handle it in short work time, I could change from framework to framework without having too much truble to learn it and undertand it quickly.

# Final considerations
Hope with this you can judge my capabilities to quickly learn new frameworks, and develop.

Of course, I can not build extremely beautiful and responsive applications while sharing my time with a lot of different other application processes, but with the proper time and the proper incentive, I can.

Hope you enjoy my way to think and give me an opportunity to explain my crazy solutions when I had to worry.
